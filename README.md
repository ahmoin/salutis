# Salutis

## Your mental health companion

## How Salutis is built
Salutis is built using Next.js 15 with React 19 for the frontend, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for styling, and Convex for real-time backend and authentication. Our process at Salutis includes researching mental health resources, designing accessible interfaces, developing core features, and integrating them into a smooth, responsive experience.

## What's next for Salutis
Our short-term goals include expanding breathing exercises, adding more forms of progress tracking, and enhancing the chatbotâ€™s mental health knowledge & features. After that, we plan to partner with professionals, build a mobile app, and create more personalized learning paths. Long term, we aim to serve schools, workplaces, and global communities with multilingual support and healthcare integration. Sustainability will come from partnerships, grants, and keeping core features free.
